# Welcome to Maestro Test

I'm [juzmcmuz](https://www.juzmcmuz.com) and this is a test.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Goals

1. Be Better (as measured by X)
2. Be Smarter (as measured by Y)
3. Be Richer (as measured by Z)

Don't forget **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text!
